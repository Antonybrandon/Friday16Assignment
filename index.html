  <h3><strong>About me</strong></h3>
<p>I have jumped from one education system  to another wich affectd my in my final grade but i dont use that as an excuse in my grades.I begun with the Kenyan Education system which is 844 till class 3 them moved to igcse for a couple of years(around 6years) then my Mom wanted me to move to a school founded by the church we attented into Form1 which meant i had to move class behind for me to do K.C.P.E,i did my K.C.P.E which went terrebly but still managed to join the school i did 844 highschool till form 2 then switched to Igcse for an year then switched back to 844 due to personal reasons to complete my K.C.S.E in form 4.I did my K.C.S.E and performed way better than i had expected.Then finally did my Igcse exams which i performed superbly.</p>
<p>I decide to take programming classes at Moringa School to gain skills which i belive should be basic and very relevant in our lives right now and the future and a field that i might engage in later on in my life.</p>
